## üß† Prompt Design Explanation

I have used the Structured ouput response feature of the OpenAI API.
Also have used Vercel AI SDK to make it more optimized to work with Nextjs

* **Design Principles**:
  * **Clarity** ‚Äì Prompts are concise and purpose-specific to improve reliability.
  * **Consistency** ‚Äì Uses predictable formatting to standardize responses.
  * **Simplicity** ‚Äì It is a short and simple prompt to extract the exact info about the portfolio

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & What‚Äôs Next

### Known Limitations

* The ouput from the OpenAI API could be way more better
* There can be mini UI bugs in some places
* The schema fields are not the best, they can be way more optimized
* There can be more strict checks in the server actions


### What I‚Äôd Build Next

* Make the AI response better
* Add a chat to portfolio feature
* Show more informaiton to the user about the Stocks they hold
